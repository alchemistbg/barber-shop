        <ul class="pnf-reasons">
            <li>If you think the problem is with us (for example: you came here from a wrong link in the RazoR web site), please <a href="mailto://therazor@razor.com">send an email describing how you got here</a>.</li>
            <li>If you followed a link from an external page, the address may have changed, so use the search engine on RazoR.</li>
            <li>If you are not sure what exactly happened, you can return to the <a href="/">RazoR homepage</a>.</li>
